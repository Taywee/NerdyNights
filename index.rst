Welcome to Nerdy Nights
=======================

This is a sphinx-translated version of the `Nerdy Nights`_ NES
programming tutorial.

.. warning::
    This is a work in progress, and not the original work

    I am not any of the original writer of Nerdy Nights.  It is also not
    finished.  Most of the base tutorial hasn't been properly formatted, and
    the rest of the tutorials haven't even been imported.  As long as this
    warning is here, you're probably better off checking out the original
    `Nerdy Nights`_ instead.
