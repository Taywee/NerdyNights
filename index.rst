Welcome to Nerdy Nights

This is a sphinx-translated version of the `Nerdy Nights`_ NES
programming tutorial.

.. warning::
    This is a work in progress, and not the original work

    I am not any of the original writer of Nerdy Nights.  It is also not
    finished.  Most of the base tutorial is done, but Advanced Nerdy Nights,
    Hacking 1, and Sound all need to be converted and set up.  As long as this
    warning is here, you might be better off checking out the `original <Nerdy
    Nights_>`_ instead.
